    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to lower
      cholesterol, and it is about as healthy as fish can get. But that is
      really a side benefit to this great-tasting main-course salad. It fits
      into the Motivating Mondays scenario, but I would happily serve it any day
      of the week and for any occasion. The warm orzo salad, with crunchy pine
      nuts, fresh basil, tender spinach, and tangy feta, is also good on its
      own. The salmon can also be cooked in a ridged grill pan.
